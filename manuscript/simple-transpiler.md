# Creating a DSL

Hints: 
- 'FAB' is a short-form for 'fabrication'.  
- Use non-ASCII quotes in pairs and non-ASCII brackets in pairs for easy matching by PEG-based parsers like Ohm-JS.
- COPY/PASTE the above DSL into an example section of the Ohm-Editor, then see if you can create a grammar that groks this DSL.
